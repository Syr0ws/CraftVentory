**CraftVentory** is a **Java / Spigot** library that facilitates the development of **Minecraft inventories**. 
It enables **developers** to define **fully configurable** inventories in **configuration files** and provide 
them with **Java code** in **their plugins**.

This library was developed to facilitate the development of in-game inventories. Indeed, making them **fully configurable** 
is an important feature for **server administrators** but this process is very tedious without an appropriate tool. 
CraftVentory solves this problem by providing a lot of **built-in features** to help **developers** implement 
**fully customizable** inventories very easily.

## Features

CraftVentory comes with the following features:
- Fully customizable **inventories / items / paginations** from configuration files (**YAML** support).
- Fully customizable **actions** when **clicking** on **items** like sending messages / sounds, executing commands, inventory navigation, etc.
- **Paginations** to paginate a large list of results in an inventory.
- **Placeholders** to display custom values in texts (inventory title, item name / lore, etc.).
- **Inventory history** to enable players to easily navigate between inventories (home, backward, forward).
- **I18n** support.
- **Enhancements** to dynamically modify inventory properties with Java code.
- **Hooks** to execute custom Java code for an inventory when specific events happen.

## Documentation

The documentation of the library is available on its [wiki](https://syrows-development.gitbook.io/craftventory/).
