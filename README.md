**FastInventory** is a **Java** / **Spigot** library that facilitates the development of **Minecraft inventories**. 
It enables **developers** to define **fully configurable** inventories in **configuration files** and provide them with **Java code**.

This library was developed to facilitate the development of in-game inventories. Indeed, making them **fully configurable** 
is an important feature for **server administrators** but this process is very tedious without an appropriate tool. 
FastInventory solves this problem by providing a lot of **built-in features** to help **developers** implement fully 
**customizable** inventories very easily.

## Features

FastInventory comes with the following features:
- Fully customizable **inventories** and **items** in configuration files (YAML support)
- Fully customizable **actions** when clicking on items (ex: message sending, close inventory, command execution, etc.)
- Fully configurable **paginations** to paginate a large list of results
- **Placeholders** for texts (ex: inventory title, item name, item lore, etc.)
- **I18n** support
- **Enhancements** with Java code

## Documentation

The documentation of the library is available on its [wiki](https://syrows-development.gitbook.io/fastinventory/).
